### Claim 1: The Total Myth of Ocean Acidification
_Link: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/06/05/the-total-myth-of-ocean-acidification/_

This article attempts to prove that anthropogenic ocean acidification, a process well agreed upon by climate scientists, is not occurring. This article is persuasive due to its seeming scientific validity, using graphs and figures from peer reviewed papers, while not giving context in order to support the author’s point.

### Claim 2: Canada Is Only Warming at ½ the Rate of Climate Models
_Link: https://www.drroyspencer.com/2021/01/canada-is-warming-at-only-1-2-the-rate-of-climate-model-simulations/_

This article investigates the current rate of temperature increase in Canada compared to that of 108 different models, and concludes that Canada is warming at less than half of the rate predicted by these models. The persuasive attributes of this article can be attributed to its use of models and graphs which can make the reader believe it is scientifically accurate.

### Claim 3: Ocean Temperature Is Not Rising Significantly
_Link: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/16/the-ocean-warming-enigma/_

This article attempts to deny that a significant temperature increase has occurred in the ocean since 1958 due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This article is convincing because it uses statements which seem to contradict the scientific consensus, building uncertainty and distrust from the reader to this community.

### Claim 4: Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Levels Have a Positive effect on _Bothriochloa Ischaemum_, a Species of Grass

This article summarizes the findings of a peer reviewed article that examines the growth of Bothriochloa ischaemum, a species of grass at different concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> discovering that biomass increases with higher amounts of CO<sub>2</sub>. This article is convincing due to the usage of a peer reviewed article as evidence, and its thorough explanation of why this may apply to global plants in addition to this grass species.

### Claim 5: The Temperature Observed Today is Not Extraordinary, According to a Swedish Fjord

This article attempts to demonstrate that a 2500 year temperature record obtained from a Swedish Fjord shows that the temperature and warming observed in the modern anthropogenic era is not extraordinary and has been observed several times throughout the past. This article is convincing due to the graph it provides, obtained from a scientific paper, and also due to its exploitation of the general uncertainty surrounding past warmings and their causes. 

## Top Claim Analysis: The "myth" of Ocean Acidification

“The total myth of ocean acidification”, written by David Middleton, and published in June 2018 to ]Watts Up With That”, had the intent to prove that anthropogenic-caused ocean acidification (OA) is non-existent. This process, which is well supported by scientific evidence, details the decrease in pH which occurs when the ocean absorbs increasing amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> (Kroeker et al., 2013). This process was examined by the author from several angles in an attempt to prove its falsehood. Firstly, the author questions the term “acidification” and points out the fact that ocean water is not acidic, nor would it be with significant anthropogenic emissions. He supports this theory using a study which examined hydrothermal vents and discovered that even at high emissions (up to 5600 ppm), ocean water remains alkaline . He thus blames the term “acidification” on fear mongering and links it to communist ideas. The author then calls into question the general uncertainty of ocean pH research, as the data collection period is close to only 30 years, which the author describes as a “geological nanosecond”. Finally, the author concludes this article by stating that the ocean has seen acidification trends in the past, such as during the beginning of the Holocene, and life during these periods has continued. He concludes this article with a summarizing census; OA is nothing to worry about. This article was chosen, as it is a perfect representation of the divide between climate change advocates and deniers, as deniers typically believe that climate change is a natural process with no human interference and few impacts on humanity. The author, David Middleton, has his own website entitled Debunk House, where he further attempts to disprove climate-related claims. On this website, he states that he received a Bachelor of Science in Earth Science from Southern Connecticut State University. In addition, he states that he works as a geoscientist in the oil industry (Middleton, 2018). From reading this article, it is very clear that it is intended for a less scientifically educated audience, as it features very few difficult scientific terms and concepts, and has several informal sentences and references to pop culture. This article consists of several accurate scientific points; however, the general argument proposed by the article is incorrect and dangerous to spread. For example, as stated by the author, ocean pH values are not likely to decrease below 7.0, marking them as acidic, due to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions alone (Turley and Gattuso, 2012). The author can thus reference this fact with scientific studies (Kerrison et al., 2011), which can reassure the reader that this point is valid. However, offsetting average pH in the ocean and on the coasts, even to a smaller degree, can lead to a significant reduction in calcite species populations, with smaller effects on other marine life (Kroeker et al., 2013; Albright and Langdon, 2011; Fitzer et al., 2014) Furthermore, the ecological consequences of this on other organisms are unknown, but must be considered (Fabry et al., 2008). In addition to this, the rate of OA, which is higher than any observed in history, is not mentioned in this article (Hönisch et al., 2012). This is a key component of this issue, and is the largest reason why it is linked to anthropogenic activity and not natural processes. The author additionally addresses the uncertainty which exists in this field, as many scientists are unsure of the total effect OA will have. However, this uncertainty is in the degree of its impact (Logan, 2010), whereas the author attributes it to a lack of consensus in the scientific community. While the individual arguments proposed by the author are fundamentally valid, the conclusion is not. The structure of this article is problematic, as it gives the facade of making an argument while ignoring key components of OA. Due to the author's connection to the oil industry, this article is biased in nature and cannot be deemed credible.

## Common Traits of Persuasive Articles

The most impactful articles tend to have several similarities which help with their persuasive quality. Many of these articles improperly use graphs from scientific articles to depict a trend without fully describing the graph or the reasoning behind it, thus fabricating a trend and claiming it to be supported by research. Additionally, these authors tend to focus on a very specific model or species which may be positively influenced by global warming. Hasty generalization is then used to state that all or most species can be positively affected by global warming, or that the positive effects on certain species would equal the negative effects, leading to a net neutral change in biodiversity. Terms such as “climate alarmists” and “warmunists”, which are frequently used, are ad hominems meant for the reader to develop a distrust in researchers. These tactics result in scientific credibility only being given to the author, despite their misuse of significant scientific information.
